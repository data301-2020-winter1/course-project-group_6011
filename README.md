## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words


	I hope to do some interesting data analytics, perhaps find some patterns in the data. I'm also interested in seeing 	what type of trends arise from the analysis of adult income data. As of right now I dont really know what else I 		hope to do with the project. This was not my original dataset of choice, but I ended up with this one because my 	original dataset was too large. The chosen dataset contains interesting data about adults, such as age, sex, 		income, profession, ect. One question I have is "How do factors like age, sex, and marital status actually effect 	a persons income? As of right now I do not have any other specific questions because I have not looked at the data 		enough. I think it would be interesting to visualize our data in an interactive dashboard style display. I don't 	have much knowledge of data dashboards so I can't speculate much on the topic.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data was collected May 1st, 1996. This dataset is primarily for 		learning and research as it is cited in many academic papers. The data was collected from the census database.
